      <o>Discovery:</o><br />
      Tejas Thackeray and his team discovered a new freshwater fish species in
      the Western Ghats, specifically near Amboli in Sawantwadi Tehsil of
      Sindhudurga district, Maharashtra. The fish was first spotted in the pond
      at the Mahadev temple. Named as Schistura hiranyakeshi, the name is
      derived from its subspecies Schistura and the nearby Hiranyakeshi
      River. Maharashtra government declared the region as a biodiversity
      heritage site to conserve the species.
    </p>
    <p><br />
      <b> Distribution: </b><br />
      Endemic to the Temple pond or 'Kund" which is at the origin of the
      Hinanyakeshi River, Amboli, Sindhudurga.
    </p>
    <p><br />
      <b>Etymology:</b><br />
      Schistura: Greek, schizein = to divide + Greek, oura = tail; an allusion
      to forked caudal fins hiranyakeshi: Named for the place of its type
      locality, Hiranyakeshi River, India. The species is named after the
      Hiranyakeshi River in Sindhudurga District of Maharashtra. The epithet
      "hinanyakeshi" in Sanskrit means golden hair. Further, this also alludes
      to the golden-yellow coloration and stripes found on the body of adult
      specimens.
    </p>
    <p><br />
      <b>Diagnosis:</b><br/>
      This species is distinguished from its congeners in the peninsular, northeastern, and central India, and Sri Lanka
      by the following characters: an incomplete lateral line with 6-7 pores, ending at a point vertical at half the
      length of the adpressed pectoral fin; dorsal fin and caudal fin without spots or blotches; body with 9-10 bars
      that are wider or almost equal in width to the interspaces; dorsal fin, anal fin and sub-dorsal bars have a unique
      crimson color in adult males; live and preserved specimens have the lower lip with a black mark on each side of
      the median interruption; no suborbital flap or axillary pelvic lobe
    </p>

      <b>Importance of the area:</b><br />
      The 2.11-hectare area near Amboli becomes the 5th biodiversity heritage
      site (BHS) in Maharashtra. Other BHS in Maharashtra include Glory of
      Allapalli, Landor Khori Park, Ganesh Khind, and the Myristica swamp in
      Sindhudurga.The fish Schistura hiranyakeshi was spotted for the first
      time in a pond at the Mahadev Temple at Amboli in Sindhudurga district ,
      Western Ghats . The fish was found by the team led by Tejas Thackeray, a
      wildlife researcher, and son of Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray. The
      Hiranyakeshi river originates from inside the temple caves with its
      waters flowing towards Jakatwadi, a small village near Amboli. The
      Temple pond or Kund to which this species is endemic to is located at
      the origin of this river, Researchers have conducted surveys across the
      landscape to identify new locations for this species, however, it was
      found that the Temple: pond is the only stronghold of this species. The
      researchers did not identify a single new population outside the town of
      Amboli in Sindhudurga where the species can be found in good numbers.
      Further, the area is also considered a "Devrai" or "Sacred Groves" by
      the villagers since generations. Which makes this not only a special location
      because the species endemic nature but also because it is considered a
      holy ground for the local community.

    <p><br />
      <b>Conservation Biodiversity Heritage Site: </b><br />The Maharashtra Government took its first step to set up the
      "Schistura hiranyakeshi Biodiversity Heritage site on 31st March 2021.
      This was done with a view to save this newly described freshwater fish,
      this makes initiative a first of its kind in the country which is
      wholly dedicated to a lesser-known species. The local inhabitants have long
      considered this fish to be a "divine fish" which protects the villagers
      from evil forces prevalent outside The villagers have committed to
      protect this species from extinction. To: honour this commitment, the
      villagers have joined hands with scientists, researchers and local NGOs
      in creating a unique "Temple Community Conservation model for this
      freshwater fish, This unique model will set a precedent, to showcase
      that with little effort from the local community backed by scientific
      research and willing government, will slowly but surely lead to an
      overall conservation of this sacred species
